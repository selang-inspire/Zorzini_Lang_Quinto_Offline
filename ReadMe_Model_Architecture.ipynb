    "- A data loading section (for example from excel file xlsx), that stores data in dataframe type (pandas library)\n",

This will allow communication between the computer (in which the server of influx is running! make sure to launch it before doing anything). There is a language difference between just installing the server on the raspberry and using the client extension.  \n",

    "The server will run on the local host of the central device. To connect the collecting devices to it, the IP address of the central device will have to be known (either we are using a wire ore wireless WiFi connection). \n",

    "Once the IP address is known, the url variable need  to be adjusted accordingly (make sure to add the port of the PC in which the server is running, in the following case the port is 8086 bt it can be diffferent according to the download preferences). It is important to check that the devices are actually communicating through the right IP address BEFORE running the code.\n",
